# Student Registration and CGPA Calculation System

## Description

This project is a simple web-based system for student registration and CGPA calculation. It consists of two main features:

1. **Student Registration**: Allows a student to input their details, which are then displayed on a confirmation page.
2. **CGPA Calculation**: Allows a student to input their grades for different subjects, and the system calculates the CGPA based on these grades.

The system is built using **HTML** for the front-end and **PHP** for server-side processing.

## Features

- **Student Registration**: Students can input their name, roll number, course, and CGPA.
- **CGPA Calculation**: Students can input their grades for different subjects, and the system calculates their CGPA.
- **Server-Side Processing**: All user data is processed and displayed using PHP scripts.

## How It Works

1. **Student Registration**:
    - The user navigates to the registration page (`reg.html`).
    - They enter their details and submit the form.
    - The entered data is displayed on a new page (`view.php`).

2. **CGPA Calculation**:
    - The user navigates to the CGPA calculation page (`result.html`).
    - They enter their grades for different subjects.
    - The grades are sent to the server, and the CGPA is calculated and displayed (`view.php`).
